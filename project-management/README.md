## Assessment Methodology

The reassessment process follows this structure:
1. **Discovery**: Automated analysis of project structure and dependencies
2. **Verification**: Cross-checking implementation against documentation
3. **Testing**: Validation of all quality gates and standards
4. **Reporting**: Generation of detailed findings and recommendations
5. **Planning**: Prioritized action items for improvement

## Quality Gates

Project assessments enforce these standards:
- All tests must pass before proceeding
- Security scans must show no critical vulnerabilities
- Documentation must be synchronized with current code
- Code coverage must meet minimum thresholds
- Performance benchmarks must be satisfied

## Deliverables

Each assessment produces:
- **Status Report**: Current project health and compliance
- **Gap Analysis**: Missing or outdated components
- **Action Plan**: Prioritized improvement recommendations
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies
